.SH NAME
.PP
cpc - An interpreter for CAIE Pseudocode.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]cpc\f[R] [\f[I]FILE_PATH\f[R]] [\f[I]OPTIONS\f[R]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]cpc\f[R] is a simple interpreter for CAIE Pseudocode written in
Python3.
The language regulated by CAIE has a really retro grammar and even some
grammar is not good for both developers and the interpreter.
Thus, some unimportant grammars are changed in this interpreter.
For more detailed information about this, you may look at README or
<https://github.com/iewnfod/CAIE_Code>.
